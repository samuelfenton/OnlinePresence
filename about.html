<div id="mainDiv">
	<p>I am an avid programmer however. To this end I jumped from programming as a hobby to studying Games Programming.</p>
	<p>Bsides several projects I work on on the side, I have a keen interest in several fields</p>
	<p><strong>AI!</strong> 
	Anything and all that is AI will draw me in. To this extent I've attempted to create my own genetic neural network to play tanks, which works in theory.
	</p>
	<p><strong>GRAPICS!</strong> 
	Now I once implemented my own graphics and physic engine using C++. The physics side was an absolute blast(GJK in 3D is a thing of beauty), while the graphics was pure hell. 
	But by the end I can not deny how spectacular and impressive any graphics system is. And this has led to my new love/hate relationship with shaders.
