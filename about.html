<div id="mainDiv">
    <p>I have always been an avid programmer. To this end I jumped from programming as a hobby to studying Games Programming.</p>
    <p>Besides several projects I work on the side, I have a keen interest in several fields</p>
    <p>
        <strong>AI!</strong>
        Anything and all that is AI will draw me in. To this extent I've attempted to create my own neural network to play tanks.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>GRAPICS!</strong>
        Now I once implemented my own graphics and physic engine using C++. The physics side was an absolute blast (GJK in 3D is a thing of beauty), while the graphics was pure hell.
        But by the end I cannot deny how spectacular and impressive any graphics system is. And this has led to my new love/hate relationship with shaders.
    </p>
    <strong>Languages</strong>
    Currently my strongest language is C#, due majority of my projects being done in Unity. Besides this I am experienced in C++ as seen in the physics/graphics engine I built, as well as dabbling in several other languages including MySQL, PHP and HLSL.
