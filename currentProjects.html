		<h1>Ragtime Heist</h1>
		<p>
		Ive been told many times before to not describe this game as "XCOM set in 1920's", but that truely is what it amounts to gameplay wise. The new JUICY part is how the AI for this game will be implemented.
		In particular the addition of GOAP(<a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/goal-oriented-action-planning-for-a-smarter-ai--cms-20793">What is GOAP</a>)to allow NPC's in the level
		to not feel like your typical AI, rather almost like another player which can dynamically react to what happens.

		<h1>This Website?</h1>
		<p>
		I guess as this site will always be updated at one point of another I'll count it as a current project. You can clearly see my specatular HTML coding abiliy at work here... 
		Alright you got me I did a class once. But to be honest, I'm still quite happy with it, beats a lot of other websites out there.
