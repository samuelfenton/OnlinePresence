		<h1>Ragtime Heist</h1>
		<p>
		Ragtime heist is a turn based tactical stealth game created which was crated over the course of 5 months. Key componets of this project include the develoment of GOAP(<a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/goal-oriented-action-planning-for-a-smarter-ai--cms-20793">What is GOAP</a>) to allow NPC's in the level to dynamically react to what happens. This was also my first attempt into using root motion for all movement of players.

		<h1>Faber Nights</h1>
		<p>
		Faber Nights is a 2.5D sidescrolling platformer, currently in the early stages of development. Its most prominent feature is the method of navigation. While side scrolling the path itself bends around the world as seen below. This allows a 2D game to included more options for pathing, and overall changes how the enviroment is crafted.

		<h1>Pixeliser</h1>
		<p>
		Pixeliser is my first attempt intto custom shaders. In particular this geometry shader is focused on converting an already existing model into a voxel counterpart. Also allowing for animations to be played in real time with voxel placment being locked into a world "grid".
