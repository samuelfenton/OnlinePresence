		<h1>Neon Odessy</h1>
		<p>
		Neon Odessy was my fist major project being developed over 4 months. It is a co-op twin stick side scroller. Although it was nothing too spectacular; I was able to learn a lot about behaviour trees for AI as well as moveent driven by raycasting rather than a rigidbody.

		<h1>CMD Clicker</h1>
		<p>
		CMD Clicker is an implementation of a clicker game in a command line. It included ASCII art for a basic UI, and keyboard inputs. As an assignment piece this was my first step into customising how consols can be customised.
