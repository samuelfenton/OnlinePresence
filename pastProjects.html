        <h1>Neon Odyssey</h1>
        <p>
            Neon Odyssey was my first major project being developed over 4 months. It is a co-op twin stick side scroller. Although it was nothing too spectacular; I was able to learn a lot about behavior trees for AI as well as movement driven by ray-casting rather than a rigid body.

		<h1>Global Game Jam 2018 - Data Drone</h1>
        <p>
            For the 2018 Global Game Jam, teams required to create a game with the theme transmission (<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/data-drone">Data Drone on Global Game Jam</a>). We decided to create Data Drone. Players would be able to transfer between different robot types in order to achieve the goal or reaching the end of the level. This created the challenge of implementing three different control schemes and designing puzzles in such a small time.

		<h1>CMD Clicker</h1>
        <p>
            CMD Clicker is an implementation of a clicker game in a command line. It included ASCII art for a basic UI, and keyboard inputs. As an assignment piece this was my first step into customizing consoles.
